My birth name is Alex Yeary; my writing pseudonym is Caldwell Whyse; programmers, gamers, and the Internet know me as WhyseRabbit. My life has been dedicated to making the world around me kinder, more receptive, and just _more_. I believe people underestimate their own worth and it takes the eyes of others to see what is truly wonderful.

It took me until my 30s to realize, I could have a further reach. I could learn a skill that might allow me to touch the world, or at least a community. I went to Lambda School with very little to lose and a whole future to gain. It is my life's mission to make this world a better place for everyone with the sheer, irrefutable power of data.

### My Interests

- I have always dreamed of publishing a novel (or many novels).
- My music taste is ecclectic. Here are some examples:

   - [Glass Animals-- Gooey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIA1XQnAv5s)
   - [The Birthday Massacre-- The Sky Will Turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLobWcKG8mo)
