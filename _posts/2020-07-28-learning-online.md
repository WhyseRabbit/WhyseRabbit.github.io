# Learning Takes Time

### Note for readers: The DataFrame being used is far too large to be hosted on GitHub. You can find the pertinent information on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/junyiacademy/learning-activity-public-dataset-by-junyi-academy). To solve this problem, I read in a 5% sample of the largest data, which equates to 810,866 observations.
