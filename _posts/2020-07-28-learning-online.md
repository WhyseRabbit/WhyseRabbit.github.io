# Learning Takes Time

## Note for readers: The DataFrame being used is far too large to be hosted on GitHub. You can find the pertinent information on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/junyiacademy/learning-activity-public-dataset-by-junyi-academy). To solve this problem, I read in a 5% sample of the largest data, which equates to 810,866 observations.

#### Working Hypothesis: The more time and effort a student puts into learning a subject matter (in this case, math) makes it more likely for a student to learn that subject.

- `Choose which observations you will use to train, validate, and test your model.`
- `How is your target distributed?`
- `Choose your evaluation metric(s).`
- `Choose your target. Which column in your tabular dataset will you predict?`
