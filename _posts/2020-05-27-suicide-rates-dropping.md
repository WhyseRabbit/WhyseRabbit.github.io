According to Jamie Ballard, a contributor to [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2018/09/13/americans-depression-suicide-mental-health), one out of three people in America know someone who has died from suicide-- this is not even counting the people who have survived attempts. Are things better or worse than before? And are these changes happening on a global scale?

- A glance five years later-- whoa! Where did Hungary come from. _resists making ovious pun between "Hungary" and "hungry"_
