According to Jamie Ballard, a contributor to [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2018/09/13/americans-depression-suicide-mental-health), one out of three Americans know someone who has died from suicide-- this is not even counting the people who have survived attempts. Are things better or worse than before? And are these changes happening on a global scale?

- They say the 80's was a weird time, but it seems a majority of people couldn't complain. Except Bulgaria and Austria.

![1992 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates92.jpg)

- A glance five years later-- overall, the numbers look similar, other than the spike in Hungary, which could be explained by one [L치szl칩 Andor](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13523279208415181?journalCode=fjcs19) as "The Year of Bankruptcies."

![1993 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates93.jpg)

- Here we can see that in many places, the numbers are higher than just the previous year. According to [Victoria Mikow](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED383986.pdf), factors such as age, gender, and even race might contribute to suicide rates.

#### Global Suicide Rates 1997
![1997 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates97.jpg)

- Hungary, Luxembourg, and Lithuania have the highest numbers in '97. A cursory search for causes within this timeframe gave no definitive causes. This is not great for data, but sometimes life (or death) happens.

#### Global Suicide Rates 2004

![2004 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates04.jpg)

- Republic of Korea. Enough said.

#### Global Suicide Rates 2010

![2010 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates10.jpg)

- Overall, the suicide rates have fallen on a global scale, with the exception of a few outlyers. With awareness, vigilance, and the ability to communicate openly and honestly, I believe we can see these numbers might drop further.


## Project Documentation, Sources, and Colaboratory Notebook

- The first challenge of this project was how to clearly and effectively communicate my findings through visualizations with my limited knowledge. I had originally wanted to use a cloropleth, but the errors in my code took more time than anticipated to troubleshoot.
- My next challenge was having to learn on the fly, with no prior practice or experience, how to build my blog site.
- I acknowlege this project is not pretty-- uneven lines, titles with random sizes... I wanted to embed the charts, but was having a difficult time doing the coding within the time frame.
