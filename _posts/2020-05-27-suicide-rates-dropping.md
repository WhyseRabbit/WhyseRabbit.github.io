According to Jamie Ballard, a contributor to [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2018/09/13/americans-depression-suicide-mental-health), one out of three Americans know someone who has died from suicide-- this is not even counting the people who have survived attempts. Are things better or worse than before? And are these changes happening on a global scale?

- They say the 80's was a weird time, but it seems a majority of people couldn't complain. Except Bulgaria and Austria.

![1992 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates92.jpg)

- A glance five years later-- overall, the numbers look similar, other than the spike in Hungary.

![1993 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates93.jpg)

- Here we can see that in many places, the numbers are higher than just the previous year. What had people so freaked out?

#### Global Suicide Rates 1997
![1997 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates97.jpg)

- Hungary, Luxembourg, and Lithuania have the highest numbers in '97. (More research needed)

#### Global Suicide Rates 2004

#### Global Suicide Rates 2010

- Summary goes here.


## Project Documentation, Sources, and Colaboratory Notebook

- The first challenge of this project was how to clearly and effectively communicate my findings through visualizations with my limited knowledge. I had originally wanted to use a cloropleth, but the errors in my code took more time than anticipated to troubleshoot.
- My next challenge was having to learn on the fly, with no prior practice or experience, how to build my blog site.
- I acknowlege this project is not pretty-- uneven lines, titles with random sizes... I wanted to embed the charts, but was having a difficult time doing the coding within the time frame.
