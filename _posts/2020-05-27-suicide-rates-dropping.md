According to Jamie Ballard, a contributor to [YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2018/09/13/americans-depression-suicide-mental-health), one out of three people in America know someone who has died from suicide-- this is not even counting the people who have survived attempts. Are things better or worse than before? And are these changes happening on a global scale?

- They say the 80's was a weird time, but it seems a majority of people couldn't complain. Except Bulgaria and Austria.

- A glance five years later-- overall, the numbers look similar, other than the spike in Hungary.

![1993 rates](https://whyserabbit.github.io/assets/img/rates93.jpg)

- Here we can see that in many places, the numbers are higher than just the previous year. What had people so freaked out?
